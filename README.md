# 1181102223 - 2204 - Retail Pharmacy Inventory Management System

This project is a web application built using Django for the intention of making it easy for retail pharmacies to monitor, manage and get insights on their inventories even if there are many branches. 

There are 3 main users: Admin, Pharmacist and Assistant. The admin oversees the operations, manages user roles and registers or removes branch data. Pharmacists and Assistants work within their respective branches, with Pharmacists dealing with the patients and important reports, and the Assistants doing more clerical tasks such as managing the inventory and checking out customers through the point of sales. 

For details on how to set up this application on your machine, please refer to Appendix G: User Guide within the FYP report.
